Summary: 
The goal of this project was to implement a multithreaded encryptor for a txt file.
the program has to read characters from an input txt file, encrypt the text and write the encypted characters to an output. 
the program should also count the number of occurences of each letter in the input and output files. 
We made changes to the encrypt-driver.c file to make this work.
